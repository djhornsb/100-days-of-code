# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started work on a vehicle tracking system written in Python.

**Thoughts:** I am unsure if I am even going about this the right way, but I will forge ahead. Python is a pretty new language for me, but there are tons of resources out there and learning the language is actually quite easy.
